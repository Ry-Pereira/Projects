Purpose: The program is used to cipher text into Morse code or decipher Morse code into text, based on user input.

Usefulness: Any user who wants to learn how Morse code works, wishes to cipher text into Morse code, or wants to decipher Morse code.

Instructions: Upon launching the program, you will be greeted with a menu. From there, you can choose to cipher text into Morse code, decipher Morse code into text, or display the alphabet and numbers corresponding to Morse code. To cipher text into Morse code, the program will prompt you for text input. You should provide textual input based on the provided alphabet and numbers, and the program will then return and print the ciphered Morse code. For deciphering Morse code into text, you will provide the program with Morse code input. To input Morse code, print the Morse corresponding to each alphabet or numeric character, adding a space between each letter in a word. To denote a space, use a space followed by "/".
